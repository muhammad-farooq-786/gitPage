        GitHub is a VCS(version control system). It helps keep different version of all of your projects.
        It is the most efficient and most used VCS by far. There are many commands to use it. Let's get 
        started:-
        <b><h2>1)Git clone</h2></b>
        There can be numerous ways to clone an existing repo. Two of them are discussed here.
        <b>1.1) clone through command line prompt. You will simply copy repository address and then use
            git clone command  </b>

        <b>1.2) clone with git app/software available for windows and mac. You will open the Git GUI and 
            paste the address</b>

        Now add some file in the cloned repository. Edit it using any code editor of your choice. From VScode
        open a new terminal to commit and push new files.

        Now add some code into your file and open terminal from the menu window.

        <b><h2>2)Git branch</h2></b>
        Now we will use git branch command to check which branch we are on at the moment. Alos we can check
        list of all branches through this command.

        <b><h2>3)Git checkout</h2></b>
        This command iss used to move to other branches where you would want to push your code. Also you can 
        make new branch through this command and move to it simultaneously.

        <b><h2>6)Git commit</h2></b>

        <b><h2>8)Git pull request</h2></b>
        Pull request command is used when the project is big and have many branches. For different features it
        may have many branches. So,after working on those features oe want to merge his/her code to the main code
        branch. Fo that purpose we use pull request.
