        GitHub is a VCS(version control system). It helps keep different version of all of your projects.
        It is the most efficient and most used VCS by far. There are many commands to use it. Let's get 
        started:-
        <b><h2>1)Git clone</h2></b>
        There can be numerous ways to clone an existing repo. Two of them are discussed here.
        <b>1.1) clone through command line prompt. You will simply copy repository address and then use
            git clone command  </b>

        Now add some file in the cloned repository. Edit it using any code editor of your choice. From VScode
        open a new terminal to commit and push new files.
